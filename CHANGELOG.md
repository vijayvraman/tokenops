## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The control plane now serves the routes `HttpStore` calls, not just `POST /v1/runs`:
  registration lookup, run records, the shared ledger (spend / inflight / halt),
  governance config, and segments/budgets/policies. With `TOKENOPS_URL` set (as in
  `make demo`) an agent could register a run and nothing else — every ledger write and
  dashboard update 404'd, so runs sat at "running" with zero cost.
- `HttpStore` no longer swallows a 404 as a successful no-op; a missing plane route
  raises instead of silently dropping the write.
- Multi-agent runs no longer overwrite each other's dashboard row. `create_run` is an
  upsert that keeps the entry agent's label and cannot rewind a finished run, and
  `update_run` appends `governance_events` and adds `steps` instead of replacing them —
  so a three-agent pipeline shows all three traces and the whole step count rather than
  whichever agent finished last.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **HTTP store** when `CONTROL_PLANE_URL` or `TOKENOPS_URL` is set: runs, governance,
  ledger, and run-records go to the AgentPlane control plane over HTTP (`HttpStore`).
  No local SQLite in that mode. `CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY` / `TOKENOPS_API_KEY` are sent
  as Bearer on those requests.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- `register_run` now upserts a dashboard `runs` row so Admin list/detail show the run
  without a separate `create_run`. Ledger spend overlays `cost_micros`; halt/clear
  keep the dashboard row in sync.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- LLM-kind Chronicle `@boundary` / `wrap_llm` runs **pre_call** via `session.on_enter`
  (and ledger admit/complete via `on_leave`). A bare `@boundary(..., kind="llm")` under
  `tokenops_run` is enough for worst-case halt / output-cap MUTATE — no `wrap_complete`
  required. `wrap_complete` still works and opts out of the double pre_call.

### Changed

- Require `agent-chronicle>=0.3.0` (on_enter / on_leave hooks).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Require `agent-chronicle>=0.2.0` (was `>=0.1.3`).
- Harden integration UX: ambient run scope and Chronicle `wrap_llm` dispatch for
  `wrap_complete` / streaming paths.

### Added

- Onboarding guide (`docs/guides/onboarding.md`) with prereqs, FAQ, and current limits.
- Broader `wrap_complete` integration coverage for seeded policies.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Initial PyPI package (`agent-tokenops`): control plane (`python -m tokenops.server`),
  SDK (`wrap_complete`, ledger/policies, Chronicle crossing hook), and Admin UI.
- Default governance seed shipped as package data (`tokenops/config/default.yaml`).
