"""Control-plane core vocabulary — LLD-faithful, single source of truth.

This module is the shared language the ledger, the policy templates, and the
harness all speak. It is deliberately small: the policies LLD reads exactly these
fields off a ``BoundaryStep`` and a ``CallRequest`` — nothing more.

Layer split (mirrors the LLD's Instrument / Attribute table):

    Instrument / IN   emits a lean ``Observation`` at each boundary exit
    Attribute         prices it, updates ``spent``, appends a ``BoundaryStep``
    Enforce           reads the ``LedgerView`` (BoundaryStep window + accumulators)

Design rules:
* Cost is micro-USD ``int`` (``Micros``) everywhere — cross-provider, no float drift.
* Telemetry/decision records are ``frozen, kw_only`` dataclasses — immutable, hashable,
  safe to share across detectors, and extensible without the argument-order trap.
* ``Detector`` / ``Policy`` are ABCs with no-op defaults — override one hook.
* Fail closed — an unknown price or unhandled action blocks; it never silently allows.
