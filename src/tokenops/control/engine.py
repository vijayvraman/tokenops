"""Engine — the policy execution harness (the LLD's Enforce module + OUT connector).

The Governor is the *mechanism*; detectors and policies are the *policy*. It owns the
three governed moments and nothing else:

    pre_call(request)  — before spend: worst-case, budget gate, oversized input
    observe(obs)       — after each crossing: record to ledger, then detect → decide → apply
    tick(now)          — on a clock: stalls, timeouts

Execution order inside a moment (worst-first):
  1. every registered Detector's hook runs, read-only, against the LedgerView → Signals
  2. Signals are sorted TRIP > WARN > OK so a preventive stop is decided before a steer
  3. each Signal is routed to its paired Policy (by name) → an Action
  4. the Action is dispatched to the OUT connector; HALT marks the ledger flag *before*
     it is applied, so the kill switch is armed even if the raise is later swallowed

Kill switch: before any moment, a run already flagged halted is refused at the IN edge —
this is what makes HALT sticky and idempotent across A2A.
